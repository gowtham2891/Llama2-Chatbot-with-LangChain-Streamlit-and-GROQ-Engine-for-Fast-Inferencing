# Llama3 Chatbot with LangChain, Streamlit, and GROQ Engine for Fast Inferencing

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the development of a high-performance chatbot using the Llama3 model, integrated with LangChain and Streamlit. The chatbot processes user queries efficiently by leveraging the GROQ engine for fast inferencing. This implementation showcases advanced natural language processing capabilities and an intuitive user interface for seamless user interaction.

## Features

- **Prompt Template:** Utilizes LangChain to define a conversation template, guiding the chatbot's responses based on user input.
- **Fast Inferencing with GROQ Engine:** Employs the GROQ engine and its Language Processing Units (LPUs) to accelerate the inferencing process, ensuring quick and efficient response times.
- **LangChain Integration:** Manages the structured workflow involving prompts and the Llama3 language model.
- **Streamlit Interface:** Provides a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the chatbot.

## Key Achievements

- Implemented a robust chatbot that uses a structured prompt template to generate accurate responses.
- Integrated the GROQ engine with LPUs to significantly enhance the speed of inferencing, demonstrating expertise in optimizing AI model performance.
- Developed a seamless workflow with LangChain, coordinating the interaction between the prompt template and the Llama3 model.
- Created an intuitive user interface with Streamlit, facilitating easy interaction with the chatbot.

## Project Workflow

1. **Prompt Template:**
   - Defines the system's role and the structure of user interactions using LangChain.

2. **LangChain Core Integration:**
   - Sets up the prompt template and connects it with the Llama3 model using necessary modules from `langchain_core` and `langchain_community`.

3. **Fast Inferencing with GROQ Engine:**
   - Utilizes the GROQ engine and its Language Processing Units (LPUs) to accelerate the inferencing process, ensuring efficient query processing and response generation.

4. **Streamlit Interface:**
   - Develops a web interface with Streamlit where users can input their queries and receive responses.

## Usage

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed. Use a `requirements.txt` file to manage dependencies and install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file with the necessary environment variables, such as your LangChain API key and GROQ engine configuration:
     ```sh
     LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     GROQ_ENGINE_CONFIG=your_groq_engine_config_here
     ```

3. **Download and Configure Required Models:**
   - Install Ollama and download the Llama3 model:
     ```sh
     ollama download Llama3
     ```

4. **Run the Streamlit App:**
   - Execute the Streamlit application to start interacting with the chatbot:
     ```sh
     streamlit run app.py
     ```

5. **Interact with the Chatbot:**
   - Open the Streamlit app in your browser, enter a query in the input box, and view the chatbot's response.

## Technologies Used

- **LangChain:** For defining the prompt template and integrating with the Llama3 model.
- **Llama3:** The language model used for generating responses.
- **Streamlit:** For creating an interactive web interface.
- **GROQ Engine:** For fast inferencing with its Language Processing Units (LPUs), significantly enhancing response times.
- **Ollama:** For downloading and managing the Llama3 model.
- **dotenv:** For managing environment variables securely.
